# Arrival-Pattern-Generator

In this project, you will build a program to check all potential arrival patterns based on random arrivals.
Assume that there are T time slots and we want to check how many different patterns there are for M
packets arriving in these T time slots. For example, some time slots may have 2 arrivals while others
have zero arrivals.
Either use MATLAB, Python, or any other programming language that you prefer.
A simplified example is T=3 and M-3. These are all the potential outcomes:
300
030
003
210
201
120
102
021
012
111
As we discussed in class; the first line shows that there are 3 packets arriving in the 1st time slot. 0
arrivals in 2nd and 3rd time slots. Etc.
Your goal in this project is to build a program to list all potential outcomes for reasonably large T and M (M-T). Consider efficiency while developing your program.
Your submission should include source code and outcomes of some executions.
